You want the excitement of sharing the experience—the laughs, the gasps, the “wait, what?” moments.  
Well guess what? CineBuddy has got you covered😎   
  
In just a few clicks, you can join or create a movie group with others who want to watch the same film, at the same time. No awkward scheduling, no cancellations. Just instant movie magic, shared with new friends or fellow fans.

When the credits roll, the group vanishes—no clutter, no hassle, just a shared experience.

## Features⚙
- **Create or Join a Group**:
  Users can form a group of any size (e.g., a cozy circle of 5 or a large public gathering) and select the movie they’d like to watch, along with a preferred showtime.
- **Open to All or Invite-Only**:
  Want to watch only with your friends or as a date? We got you covered! Groups can be made public or kept private.  If someone else wants to watch the same movie at the same time, they can easily request to join the group.
